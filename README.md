# CMP719A-FACE-DETECTION-MODEL-COMPARISON
CMP719A Project: Comparing Haar, YOLOv8-Face, and SCRFD. 

Face detection remains a core component of numerous real-world applications, including surveil-
lance systems, user authentication, photo tagging, and human-computer interaction. The primary
motivation for this project comes from a curiosity to understand the evolution of face detection
models—starting from classical rule-based techniques (Viola-Jones Haar Cascades) to modern deep
learning approaches (YOLOv8n-Face, SCRFD).
This report aims to perform a structured comparison of three different paradigms of face detection:
• The Viola-Jones framework with Haar Cascades: a classical yet historically significant and
computationally efficient method.
• YOLOv8n-Face: a modern, anchor-free real-time face detector based on a lightweight
YOLOv8 architecture.
• SCRFD: abbreviation of ”Sample and Computation Redistribution for Face Detection” a
fast and compact deep learning model optimized for mobile deployment and small face
detection.
Through extensive experimentation, this study investigates how traditional approaches perform in
contrast to deep learning-based models under real-world variability, such as scale, occlusion, and
pose. The experiments provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and
demonstrated the dramatic improvements in face detection achievable through deep learning.
